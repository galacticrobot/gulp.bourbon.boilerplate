# My Starter Gulp Boilerplate

As the title says. This is my Starter Gulp Boilerplate.  
It includes:

* [Html5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bourbon & Neat](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

It also includes some wizardry with node-bourbon and node-neat to make it work with Gulp.
